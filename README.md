# Image-classification-CNN

This project is a machine learning application for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and testing with random images from the dataset.

## Project Structure

- `imageclassification.py`: Main script containing the implementation of data preprocessing, CNN model creation, training, evaluation, and testing.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
